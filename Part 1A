"""PROG 1331 Test 1 Task B-1 Tue March 6, 2018. (Version B)

Define a function format_url() that takes a list of three strings
representing user name and domain name and returns a string containing
a URL for that user's personal web space on the server. The personal 
web space is formed with a ~ tilde character in front of the user name.
For example:
["flintstonef", "example.ca"]
becomes
"http://example.ca/~flintstonef"

If the function receives less than 2 strings in the list, it should return
an empty string "".

The main program that calls the doctest module is already given below,
you must define the function. Do not edit the docstring, it gives the
script for the doctest module.
